/**
 * cameraLibrary — Shared vocabulary for cinematic camera direction used across
 * CameraVariationsModal (Presets / Contact Sheet) and ChangeAngleModal
 * (Advanced A-then-B chain).
 *
 * Why this lives in one file
 * --------------------------
 * Every NB2 (Gemini 3.1 Flash Image) call we make for "re-photograph this
 * scene from a different camera position" pays a tax in consistency. The
 * model has no real 3D scene understanding, so the only lever we have is
 * prompt craft. Our field-tested pattern is:
 *
 *   1. Lead with an imperative verb + object ("Re-photograph ...").
 *   2. State what must be preserved — identity, costume, props, environment,
 *      lighting, art style — because NB2's default failure mode is to
 *      redesign the character rather than move the camera.
 *   3. Hand NB2 a single declarative camera-position phrase it already
 *      recognises (ECU, OTS, Dutch, over-shoulder etc.) rather than
 *      coordinate-style input (yaw/pitch/zoom) which it ignores.
 *   4. Optionally colour the shot with an emotion/intent chip, because the
 *      Notion reference library shows NB2 reacts well to "tense", "intimate",
 *      "triumphant" etc. — they bias framing and expression without
 *      overwriting subject identity.
 *   5. For big moves (distance + angle combined), use "A, then B" chaining
 *      instead of stacking adjectives: "Frame it as a WIDE ESTABLISHING
 *      SHOT, then make it a LOW-ANGLE HEROIC SHOT." This consistently beats
 *      the naive "wide low-angle heroic shot" for NB2.
 *
 * This library encodes all of the above:
 *   - CAMERA_PRESETS:  22 individual shot primitives, grouped by category.
 *   - EMOTION_CHIPS:   small adjective packs that bias framing/expression.
 *   - CONTACT_SHEET_IDS: curated 9-up grid designed to survive a single
 *                         NB2 call (distance × angle coverage).
 *   - buildPresetPrompt / buildAdvancedChainPrompt / buildContactSheetPrompt:
 *     the prompt builders each modal in this app should use. Keeping them
 *     here means any future tuning happens once, not three times.
