/**
 * Transitions — TR (transition) card image generation.
 *
 * Why a separate module?
 *   Regular scenes go through `generateConti` (brief-aware, per-scene asset
 *   refs, single prompt). Mood / Sketches go through `generateMoodImages`
 *   (Claude cinematic pre-pass + multi-shot plan). Neither fits a TR card,
 *   which is a one-frame *bridge* between two already-rendered shots.
 *
 *   Until now, TR generation was hardcoded to NB2 inpaint with a simple
 *   template prompt. It ignored the brief and couldn't follow the user's
 *   selected model (NB2 / GPT Image 2). This module unifies TR with the
 *   rest of the pipeline:
 *
 *   1. Claude pre-pass (same `claude-proxy` edge function as Mood) that
 *      reads the brief + prev / next scene context + TR directive and
 *      returns a single cinematic "transition beat" description — i.e.
 *      what the bridging frame should look like from a directorial POV.
 *      This is the "연출적 관점" the user asked for.
 *   2. Model routing identical in shape to `generateConti`:
 *        · nano-banana-2 → inpaint mode (prev as source, next as ref);
 *          NB2 blends two images better via the edits path than via
 *          generate + assetImageUrls.
 *        · gpt            → generate mode with gpt-image-2 and both
 *          adjacent images passed as `assetImageUrls`. Matches the
 *          shape used by `generateConti` so the openai-image edge
 *          function dispatches consistently.
 *
 *   Claude failure is never fatal: we fall back to a rich template
 *   prompt (ported from the old `buildTransitionPrompt` in ContiTab)
 *   so the user still gets a transition frame on a Claude outage.

const TRANSITION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `${KNOWLEDGE_TRANSITION_GRAMMAR}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You are a senior film editor and director of photography. Your single job is to design ONE bridging frame — a hero still — that visually carries a special transition effect between two already-shot cuts: Shot A (preceding) and Shot B (following).

A TR (transition) card in this project is NOT invoked for a simple edit-timing decision (hard cut, match cut, dissolve, fade). It is invoked ONLY when the director wants a real visual event — a camera move, an optical phenomenon, a digital distortion, a geometric transformation, or an environmental beat — to live as its own frame at the cut. Treat the requested technique as the reason the TR frame exists in the first place.

You will receive:
  · the project's creative brief (goal, target, USP, tone, visual direction, optional hero visual & product)
  · a narrative-context snippet — up to ±2 surrounding real scenes so you can read the story beat at the cut (opening / mid-body / climax / resolution)
  · Shot A's full context (title, description, camera, mood, location) and its rendered image as an attached reference
  · Shot B's full context and its rendered image as an attached reference
  · the requested TRANSITION TECHNIQUE key + name + its authoritative guide from the library above
  · optional transition intent written by the director

Produce a single, vivid, visual English paragraph (3–5 sentences) describing the bridging frame from a directorial standpoint. Your paragraph must obey these rules in order — rule #0 is absolute and overrides all others:

  0. ANCHOR DISCIPLINE (HARD CONSTRAINT). A TR frame represents a SINGLE MOMENT on the A→B timeline, typically at the technique's peak (~70–80% through the transition). It is NOT a composite showing both shots' subjects at equal weight. Honor the technique's declared [Anchor=…] tag exactly:
       · Anchor=ShotA → the frame lives inside Shot A; describe Shot A's subjects and environment being transformed by the technique; Shot B's subject / protagonist / product is NOT in the frame (at most a faint color-temperature edge hint is allowed if the guide permits).
       · Anchor=ShotB → symmetric inverse.
       · Anchor=Bridge → the rare case where both shots legitimately share the frame. Apply only when the technique explicitly requires it.
       · Anchor=Technique → the effect owns the frame; subjects from both shots are degraded into corrupted texture, vector ghosts, or channel offsets; neither reads as a clean present protagonist.
     Do NOT — under any circumstance, regardless of how tempting the story beat makes it — render Shot A's protagonist and Shot B's protagonist side-by-side with the effect between them. That is a crossover poster, not a transition. When in doubt, collapse to the anchor shot.
  1. Honor the requested technique as the structural spine of the frame. Apply its library entry concretely — not generically. Name the specific visual artifact of that technique (the smear of a WHIP_PAN, the shard geometry of a SHATTER, the tracking bands of a VHS_WARP, the suspended particles of a TIME_FREEZE, etc.).
  2. Preserve the identities from the ANCHOR shot (characters, wardrobe, props, location materials, mood palette) using that shot's attached reference image as ground truth. Do NOT introduce new people, props, or environments. The non-anchor shot's reference image is provided so you know what the transition is moving toward — NOT as a second subject to render in this frame.
  3. Respect the brief's visual direction (camera language, lighting, color grade) and calibrate the technique's intensity to the story position (a climax beat can punch harder than an opening beat).
  4. Describe the frame in concrete cinematography terms — what we see in foreground / midground / background, how the technique's energy is concentrated in the frame, and (if anything) where in frame a faint hint of the non-anchor shot might bleed in. If the guide does not explicitly grant the non-anchor shot a visible role, assume its subject is not in frame.
  5. If the director's transition intent is provided, treat it as the highest-priority creative directive and let it override category defaults — but rule #0 still holds unless the intent text explicitly asks for a bridge composition.

OUTPUT FORMAT: plain English prose only — no JSON, no bullet points, no markdown, no quotes. One paragraph. End with the sentence: "Do not render any text, subtitles, logos, UI overlays, or watermarks in the frame."`;

/** Resolve the effective technique for this TR. Legacy / unknown stored
 *  values normalize to `null`, and we fall back to the default at the
